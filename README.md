## Example of DevExpress XAF using Elmah##

The goal of this project is to configure [Elmah (Error Logging Modules and Handlers)](https://code.google.com/p/elmah/) for use with the [DevExpress XAF](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/) MainDemo sample. The same method can be adapted for use with any XAF website. See the [related blog post](http://blog.zerosharp.com/elmah-with-devexpress-xaf).

### Dependencies ###

Requires [DevExpress Xaf](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/). This currently uses version 14.1.7.
